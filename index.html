           <p>We are the Likharal Project, a student-led, educational outreach program from the scholars, for the future Iskolar ng Bayan. Likharal fosters the gifts of intellectually gifted students from selected elementary public schools in Davao City. With the help of Pisay's resources on different subjects such as Science, Mathematics and English, the program focuses on teaching Grade 5 students in preparation for high school.</p>

After 7 sessions of the organization, the Likharal 2023 Culmination was held on May 20th, wherein invitations were sent to the Likharal students, parents, and teachers to celebrate and have fun as the first batch of students bid their goodbyes. Later, on January 11th, 2024, Likharal announced the achievement of having 17.24% passing rate. 10 out of 58 tutees passed the NCE, including 2 main campus qualifiers. Then, on January 13, 2024, Likharal had its launching of the 2nd run, in which the students had an orientation, took evaluation exams, and had a team-building activity, and all turned out successful.</p>
